## Introduction

This project leverages computer vision techniques using YOLO (You Only Look Once) and OpenCV to implement a people detection system in a sewing environment. The application functions as an API that captures a video stream, applies YOLO and OpenCV for real-time analysis, and monitors the presence of individuals in a factory setting. By analyzing the images captured from the camera, the system automatically identifies and tracks people, providing valuable data on space occupancy and helping to prevent accidents. It is ideal for industries seeking to enhance workplace safety and optimize space management.
